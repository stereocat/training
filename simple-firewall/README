This directory includes an OpenFlow controller that controls a single
OpenFlow switch and emulates a router.

# How to run 

Run this

 % sudo trema run ./src/examples/simple_router/simple-router.rb -c ./src/examples/simple_router/simple_router_netns.conf -d 

and send packets like as follows.

 % sudo ip netns exec host1 ping 192.168.2.2

Then check flow entries in OpenFlow switch.

 % sudo trema dump_flows 0x1

This will display flow entries created by the controller.
